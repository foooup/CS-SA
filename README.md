CSlennon - Slur Archive

In this archive, there are many videos and photos 
portraying CS saying a slur, wether it be a homophobic 
slur or racist one. The files in the same file that this
.txt document is in are labeled obviously, and need no
explanation. Inside of the file "racial slurs video",
there is a secondary file called "first3 spam". Videos in
this file contain CS saying the first three letters of
the hard r over and over again. Similarly, in the homophobic
slur folder, there is a "first3" folder and contains him 
saying the first three letters of the f-slur, not 
nessesarily spam though.

There is also a folder containing pictures/snipping tools of
slurs CS said. However, this does not contain quite the same
 weight as video proof, which is why
it gets its own dedicated folder.

The file named "other unhinged shit he said" does not
contain slurs, just things that should get his
A: future carreer ruined, B: should maybe get him
arrested, C: freindship ending, or any mixture of the three

also there are some goofy pictures with edited captions
of him there


Format:

1. date ("no date" if not recorded)
2. closeness*
3. what kind of slur

E.G
10 7 2023 full n-word
10 7 2023 full f-slur

ATTENTION:
there may be some discrepancies between the formatting of 
some of the files, and honestly i dont feel like going 
through and standardizing them all. some of the old n-word
will have game names but that is now not used. Also, most
other differences arent complicated and can be figured out
with only a little bit of brain power.

*: "full" or "closeness" is how close to a slur CS says, like
if he comes close to saying one but technically dosent. A file
marked as "full" means CS just straight up said it, no strings
attached. 
Typically, if this section is not marked "full" then it will
 contain 
exactly what he said. 

CURRENT GRAND TOTAL AS OF 5/20/24:
n-word
   hard R confirmed: 4
   hard R debateable: 3
   first 3 spam: 3 times
   hard R picture: 3
   soft a picture: 3
f-slur
   full confirmed: 4
   full debateable: 0
   picture: 3

P.S. the f-slur is his favorite word to say in my opinion and
70% of the time I dont even think to clip it because how often
he says it

P.S.S. he says the f-slur wayyy more often than the archive
proves but obviously I cannot prove this.
